???

-   Reproducible research boils down to two things:
    
    1. Access to the raw data
    2. Access to the instructions to reproduce the analysis and results
-   Basically could you reproduce your research with exactly the same results? Could someone else?
-   That sounds simple, but there can be a lot to it in practice. This talk is to give some of the lessons we've learned along the way.
-   Don't mix up reproduciblity with replicability. Just because a result is reproducible does not mean it will replicate, but being reproducible is a prerequiste of being replicable.

### Benefits the research community

-   Other researchers can reuse code, see implementation of methods, find new packages
-   Find mistakes or assess impact of assumptions
-   Necessary for replication
-   An important part of open science
-   Test the impact of your assumptions

### Benefits you

-   Efficiency
-   Track a project history
-   More faith in results
-   Reproducible to you

-   Easy to think of reproducibility as a binary choice
-   But it's more like a spectrum. 
-   Each process gets you just a little bit closer to that mythical nirvana

-   In terms of getting started, writing where you code is a great place to start
-   We're talking about R infrastructure, but Python has similar methods (but R is easier). So does Julia (in infancy)
-   Lots of pros: make fewer mistakes, get consistent looking documents, generate individualised reports easily, etc

The searches yielded `r format(prisma$data$value[1], big.mark=",")` results, 
of which `r format(prisma$data$value[2], big.mark=",")` were duplicates. 
After screening titles and abstracts, we assessed `r format(prisma$data$value[5], 
big.mark=",")` full-texts for inclusion. `r str_to_sentence(numbers_to_words(
prisma$data$value[8], and=TRUE))` met the inclusion criteria and we extracted 
the data of these meta-analyses. Figure \@ref(fig:prisma) presents the full 
results of the selection process.

The searches yielded 41,928 results, of which 24,023 were duplicates. After screening titles and abstracts, we assessed 1,964 full-texts for inclusion. One hundred and nineteen met the inclusion criteria and we extracted the data of these meta-analyses. Figure 1 presents the full results of the selection process.

-   As a classic example: anyone who has done a review knows how easy it is to mess up the numbers
-   If you tie together your data and code with your writing, it's much easier to make changes without creating mistakes

-   Sharing data is a big topic, and there are lots of methods of sharing data once a paper is published.
-   This is more about during the development of the project, connecting your code to your data, so that everyone in the team could run it.
-   REDCap is great for rectangular data, or for data capture, but a pain to setup for existing datasets
-   Any data source with an API is great for reproducibility
-   We like Cloudstor for the

    -   Ease of collaboration within/outside our institution
    -   Generous data allowance
-   But the API was clunky and didn't have a good R client - so we built one

# Tips & Tricks

--

1. Move collaboration out of email

--

2. Taking a professional mindset

--

3. Reproducibility across projects: make the process repeatable

--

4. Try a retrospective to identify gaps. Build tools to fill the gaps.

--

5. One tweak per week
